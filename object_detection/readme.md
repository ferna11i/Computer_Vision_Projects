# Object Detection

For cases where the task involves identifying an object and providing the location of the object in the image I have used
object detection solutions.

Currently available implementations:
1. Face Mask Detection
		Utilzing Mask-RCNN from Detectron2 to detect if a person has worn or not worn or incorrectly worn their mask.
